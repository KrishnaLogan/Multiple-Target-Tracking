Multiple Target Tracking using Nearest Neighbor method and Game Theoretic Approach 

Network Centric Warfare environment focuses on problem involving the location, characterization and identification of dynamic entities such as 
emitters, aircrafts, weapons, military unites. 
Multiple Target Tracking is a crucial requirement for surveillance system of interpreting the environment. 
In this work proposed a new view of Multiple Target Tracking with game theoretic perspective. 
The proposed new approach combines nearest neighbor method for tracking multiple targets with the Nash Equilibrium strategy of game theory. 
This method picks valid observation-to-track pair in optimized way and handle target origin uncertainties.
